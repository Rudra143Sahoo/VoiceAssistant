# Voice Assistant Project  

A powerful and interactive **Voice Assistant** developed using **Java**, designed to process voice commands and provide real-time responses. This project demonstrates the potential of voice-enabled technology in simplifying tasks and enhancing user experience.  

## Features  
- üéôÔ∏è **Voice Recognition**: Captures and processes voice commands.  
- ‚ö° **Real-time Responses**: Responds promptly to user inputs.  
- üîÑ **Customizable Commands**: Allows you to add and modify commands for specific tasks.  
- üîå **Modular Design**: Built with a scalable and maintainable architecture.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - Java Speech API (JSAPI) for voice recognition  
  - Swing/JavaFX for UI (if applicable)  
  - Additional dependencies for natural language processing  

## How It Works  
1. The assistant listens to user commands via a microphone.  
2. Converts the audio input into text using voice recognition APIs.  
3. Processes the text input and triggers the corresponding response or action.  
4. Provides real-time feedback to the user via text or voice output.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Java JDK 8+  
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)  
- Microphone and speakers
